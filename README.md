## Project Requirements
For Project 3, you will work with your group to tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:<br>
1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).<br>
2. Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:<br>
 A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly<br>
 A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data<br>
 A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)<br>
3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.<br>
4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.<br>
5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).<br>
6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.<br>
For this project, you can focus your efforts within a specific industry.<br>
